In general: 

- Be careful with the way you are using parenthesis. They were not
strictly necessary for this lab. Use them only if necessary or if it helps with
the organization of the SQL statement.

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- PLEASE only include your queries! You included a lot of other things. You
  droped my tables when I ran your file! I am a bit upset about that.
