1. 

Evidence looks ok.

Good organization of screenshots.


2.

Minimum knowledge of the terms primary key, candidate key, and superkey. Please
review this concepts for the mid-term and final.

The distinction between a superkey and candidate key is deficient. Remember
that a candidate key is the minimum set of superkeys. 


3.

The explanation uses a simple, but good, example.


4.

There are some typos in the responses. E.g., ``... the the record ...''.

The ``frist normal form'' has nothing to do with record types. Please check
your notes and the textbook Chapter 6.1.
